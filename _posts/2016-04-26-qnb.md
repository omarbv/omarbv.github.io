## Analysis

According to the information shared, looks like the hack was made targeting the IP [213.130.121.229](https://www.virustotal.com/en/ip-address/213.130.121.229/information/), that is was supposed to be the server connected to the mobile applications. Indeed, that IP address was hosting [apps.qnb.com](http://apps.qnb.com/) and [apps.qnb.com.qa](http://apps.qnb.com.qa/) according to [VirusTotal registry](https://www.virustotal.com/en/ip-address/213.130.121.229/information/).

The bank had a big mistake, running known vulnerable software, such as Servlet 2.4, JSP and [Tomcat 4.2.3](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-45/product_id-887/opbyp-1/Apache-Tomcat.html).

According to the logs shared by the attacker, the breach was done by one of the most common attacks, a SQL injection to the backend ORACLE database server, using the sqlmap tool:
```
sqlmap identified the following injection points with a total of 9533 HTTP(s) requests
```

The server had 11 databases stored, but not all of them has been leaked in the information published:
```
[*] COMMON – Published
[*] EBPB – Published
[*] EXFSYS – Not Published
[*] IVR – Published
[*] IVRDR – Published
[*] IVRTMP – Not Published
[*] MWS – Published
[*] RETAIL – Published
[*] SYS – Not Published
[*] SYSTEM – Not Published
[*] WMSYS – Published
```
The attacker was extracting all the info, and storing it in different CSV and TXT files, sorting by folder with a thorough order.

Customer information, such as national ID numbers, passport, names and surnames, contact data, nationaly and many more privacy data was stored in the customer tables.

The attackers were able to find an upload path, for User5 and also the password:

</p>

A known web shell, openDoc.jsp, was probably used to gain access to the host, and control it escalating privileges as User5, mainly to extract information.
```
Description: jsp File browser v1.2 -- This JSP program allows remote web-based file access and manipulation. You can copy, create, move and delete files. Text files can be edited and groups of files and folders can be downloaded as a single zip file that's created on the fly.

## Summary:

- The bank was running **vulnerable software** in the targeted host.
- The breach was made using **SQL injection** and also probably using a **web shell**.
- Data published is in some cases old, that is probably because the breached host is a legacy one, or maybe just a test environment using **real data**, something not recommended, and not aligned with bank **security requirements**.
- Credit cards issued in the last years, were **legit and working**.
- Customers data, were also legit, and in some cases “whitehats” contacted them to **contrast the information**.
- The attacker was performing **stalking actions** with some of the customers, identified them as security forces or intelligence agents, as he was able to identify and provide social networks information. Including some photos, and in some cases info about their families.
 

## Update 27/04/2016: 

**Bozkurhackers**, related to the Turkish far right group [“Bozkurtlar”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_Wolves_(organization)) (Grey Wolves), has claimed responsibility for the breach in the Qatar National Bank. The claim has been made uploading a video on 25th April, a day before it was publicised. The group is spreading the video via Twitter, using several fake accounts that are closed by Twitter.

This attack could be related to the Syrian conflict, where the Grey Wolves have an active participation.
