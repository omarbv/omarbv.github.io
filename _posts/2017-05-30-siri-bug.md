## Information

After reading the post published by [Anton31Kah](https://www.reddit.com/user/Anton31Kah/) at [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/6dfex3/this_is_something_i_noticed_using_siri_since_i/), where he explains a **bug in Siri** that allows you to deactivate movile data although the iPhone is locked with a passcode. So I started to do some test regarding the WiFi.

In the **iOS 10.3.2** version is also possible to **deactivate the Wi-Fi**, also working when the iPhone device is blocked with a passcode. With this and the previous tip from Anton31Kah, it would be possible to deactivate all Internet connections in the iPhone, with no option to locate or wipe the device using iCloud.
