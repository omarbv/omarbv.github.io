## Introduction

After reading in the blog [EstudioIphone](#) about the possibility of skipping the security code in the iPhone to see contacts, make calls, etc. by using "#number" on the emergency call screen.

## Proof of Concept

From the emergency call option (on a locked device) and pushing the menu button it is possible to access to the voice control commands and perform any kind of tasks, such as calling, accessing applications or listening to music.

**Tested on OS 4.1 and OS 4.0.1**
