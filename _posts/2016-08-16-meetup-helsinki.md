After careful consideration and much thought, finally I decided to create an interesting “meetup” event in **Helsinki** focused in **CyberSecurity**, yeah, I know… cyber 🙂

The aim is to create a channel between security professionals and/or companies, in order to enhance and improve our daily tasks, share knowledge, collaboration, create community and check how other professionals (doesn’t matter if you are technical focused, lawyer, manager or an internal auditor), startups and companies that are doing Security from “other point of view”.

> Everyone has something to say.
